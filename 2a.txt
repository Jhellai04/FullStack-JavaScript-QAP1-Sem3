2.a. Write a few sentences or paragraph describing each object and how it would be used.

The 3 common core objects I chose are:
    http
    filesystem
    path

http: 
The http module is a core module in Node.js that allows you to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. 
It provides classes and methods to handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses. With http.createServer(), you can create an HTTP server, defining how it should handle incoming requests. 
This module is fundamental for building web servers in Node.js.

filesystem:
The fs module in Node.js provides an interface to interact with the file system. 
It allows you to perform various operations on files and directories, such as reading from or writing to files, creating or deleting directories, and checking file properties. 

path: 
The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps in constructing and manipulating file paths in a platform-independent way. 
This module is crucial for handling paths in a consistent manner across different operating systems.
